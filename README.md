## RepostBot
reddit Bot hosted via Heroku that resposts from r/pics for some sweet sweet karma

### Why?
This bot is built out of a desire to learn the ins and outs of building and deploying a bot securely 

In addition, I wanted to see how easily an account can rack up Reddit "karma" points by simply taking a popular picture and reposting it, a practice commonly called out by reddit users, but often after they have received thousands of (albeit worthless) points.

### Roadmap:
To build on this, I want to leverage Python's Flask library and the Plotly (or plot.js tbd) JS library to build a small web app that tracks the realtime progress and growth (or failure) of this bot. I would also like to extend this bot's capabilities past /r/pics, making it significantly more interesting and dynamic
